  1. Added Lisa's codes (with some slight cosmetic modifications)
     to do Kronecker product approximations for reflexive boundary
     conditions.  This includes:
     (a) Modified Classes/@psfMatrix/kronApprox.m to look for
         zero, reflexive or neumann boundary conditions.
     (b) Added the following functions to Classes/@psfMatrix/private/
         * zeroKronApprox.m (this replaces zeroSepApprox.m)
         * reflexKronApprox.m
         * buildHank.m
  2. Fixed some problems with TSVD.m and GCVforTSVD.m

* 6/02/02, J. Nagy
  1. Added new class, transformMatrix, to be used for direct
     methods.
  2. Modifed Classes/@psfMatrix/svd.m to compute "SVD" for 
     various boundary conditions.  The following new functions
     were added to Classes/@psfMatrix/private/
       kron_svd.m (for zero boundary conditions, and reflexive boundary
                   conditions with nonsymmetric PSF)
       fft_svd.m  (for periodic boundary conditions)
       dct_svd.m  (for reflexive boundary conditions with symmetric PSF)
  3. Modified TSVD so that it will work for various boundar conditions.

* 6/6/02, J. Nagy
  1. Added function DirectMethods/Tikhonov.m 
     (Replaces DirectMethods TLS.m from version 1.0)
     Tikhonov should now work for various boundary conditions, and
     in some cases the derivative regularization operator can be used.
     Also had to modify DirectMethods/GCVfun.m and givensDLS.m

* 10/10/02, J. Nagy
  1. Fixed a small bug in Classes/@psf/size.m

* 11/12/02, J. Nagy
  1. Fixed bug in Classes/@psfMatrix/private/issymmetric.m

* 11/17/02, J. Nagy
  1. Fixed bug in Classes/@psfMatrix/private/reflexKronApprox.m
  2. Fixed bug in Classes/@psfMatrix/private/zeroKronApprox.m

* 11/20/06, J. Nagy
  1. Added new iterative codes, HyBR, written by Julianne Chung.
     These are for testing purposes only -- some modifications will
     be needed.
  2. Added new "new_svdPrec" that seems to work better than psfPrec
  3. Some additional cosmetic changes and a few minor bugs have been
     fixed.
  4. Kronecker product codes have been updated using those developed
     from Lisa Perrone's thesis work.
