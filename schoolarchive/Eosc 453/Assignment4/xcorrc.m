% Cross correlation with confidence interval calculation. Similar
% to Matlab's xcorr but here (perc*100)% confidence intervals are
% calculated (default 90% confidence intervals, i.e. perc=0.9) for
% a random phase distribution of one time series. The confidence 
% interval is given as upper bound (bdu) and lower bound (bdl) 
% based on 'rep' repetitions (Monte Carlo approach). 
% One of the channels (does not matter which (but can't be both)) 
% has its phases randomly changed over a range of 2pi. This
% way the auto-correlation is kept unchanged (internal structure is 
% unchanged). If both channels' phases were randomly changed, the
% result for confidence intervals in cross-correlation would always
% be the same (i.e., the result for 2 random time series).
%
% y=xcorrc(a,b, ...) where a and b are length M vectors (M>1), returns the
% length 2*M-1 cross-correlation sequence y. If A and B are of
% different length, the shortest one is zero-padded. Zero time lag
% coefficient is located in y(M). 
%
% The correlation coefficients are automatically normalized to lie
% between -1 and 1 (except when flag='unbiased' is set where values 
% >1 and <-1 can occure at "large" positive and negative time
% lags), so flag = 'coeff' is redundent. 
% However 'xcorrc' can be used without confidence interval calculation by
% setting rep=0 or by not specifying rep at all.  'xcorrc' allows 
% for calculation of normalized cross correlation coefficients and
% usage of flag='unbiased' at the same time (not possible in
% original Matlab function xcorr where either flag='coeff' for
% normalization or flag='unbiased' for unbiased calculation).
%
% 'xcorrc' calculates confidence intervals by performing cross 
% correlation as spectral multiplication where the complex
% conjugate of the lag channel is used in the frequency
% domain. This is a 'biased' cross correlation, meaning that
% correlation coefficients at large positive and negative time lags 
% are getting smaller because the length of overlap between the two 
% time series (as viewed in the time domain) gets smaller.
%
% For test purposes the result from cross correlation by spectral
% multiplication is returned in yy and can be compared with y
% (which is obtained from the standard Matlab function 'xcorr').
% y and yy should be identical if flag='biased' or 'none' (which
% automatically assumes the default 'biased') is chosen.
%
% One can also set flag='unbiased' so that y contains the unbiased 
% cross correlation coefficients and the confidence interval
% between upper bound (bdu) and lower bound (bdl) are still
% calculated (however in a biased way). In any case, yy will always 
% contain biased cross correlation coefficients.
%
%
% Example of usage:
%
% To calculate unbiased cross correlation coefficients with 99%
% confidence intervals based on 100 random distributions of one 
% time series try:
%
% t=0:0.1:10*pi;
% a = cos(t);
% b = sin(t);
%
% [cross up lo] = xcorrc(a,b,'unbiased',100,0.99);
%
% figure;
% plot(cross); hold on;
% plot(up,'k-');
% plot(lo,'k-');
%
% Now 99% of all cross correlation coefficients would fall between the two 
% black (~horizontal) lines if one time series has random
% distribuitions of values with time (while its auto-correlation
% remained unchanged).

%====== standard cross correlation ===================================
% Only difference to xcorr is that normalization is done
% automatically so flag='coeff' is unnecessary. Instead 
% one can use other flag options such as 'biased' or 'unbiased'
% and thus get a normalized and biased/unbiased result.

%====== cross correlation as spectral multiplication ==================
% Doing cross correlation as spectral multiplication. This is
% identical to xcorr when flag='biased'. So this serves just as a 
% test to see if result is identical to method above. Result is
% returned in yy. 
%
% It is necessary to put the fourier-transformed lag channel in 
% its complex conjugate form to get the cross correlation,
% otherwise one does a simple convolution (i.e, spectral
% multiplication without putting lag-channel into complex conjugate 
% form)

if size(b,1) == 1 b = b'; end   % always need b as column vector

B = fft(b, 2.*length(b));  % # of DFT-points has to be twice length of b

% for following 3 lines, imaginary part is (close to) zero anyway:
a2 = real(ifft(AA)); % max value at zero-lag needed for normalization
b2 = real(ifft(BB)); % max value at zero-lag needed for normalization
c2 = real(ifft(C));  

% normalize by zero-time lag values of auto-correlations, which are always max. values:
c2 = c2 ./ sqrt(max(a2) .* max(b2));
                                    
% need to switch halfs of time series: 	
c2 = [c2(length(c2)/2+2:end)', c2(1:length(c2)/2)'];

% need to flip time series left-right:

%=============== determine confidence intervals in corr. coef. ================
% To determine confidence intervals use the spectral
% cross-correlation method. Here, one of the channels (does not
% matter which (but can't be both) has its phases randomly changed
% over a range of 2pi (has to be from -pi to pi in Matlab). This
% way the auto-correlation is kept unchanged (internal structure is 
% unchanged). If both channels' phases were randomly changed, the
% result for cross-corr. would always be the same (i.e., the result 
% for 2 random time series).
